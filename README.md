these are series of projects which use the WMATA API
special thanks to [jxmorris12](https://github.com/jxmorris12) and their [dc-metro-resize project](https://github.com/jxmorris12/dc-metro-resize/tree/master) which made the task of making [stationpositions.json](https://github.com/PaulPrice1/trainthings/blob/main/stationpositions.json) more manageable
